# Media Date Fixer

A simple, interactive PowerShell utility to batch-set or fix the creation date metadata of photo and video files using ExifTool.

## What is Media Date Fixer?

Media Date Fixer scans a folder for image or video files, extracts the correct creation date and time from the file name (e.g.,  
`Photo 23-12-16 23-30-08.jpg`,  
`Screenshot 2025-06-03 235938.png`,  
`Video 23-12-16 23-30-08.mp4`),  
and writes this date into the file's metadata using [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/).  
Processed files are copied to a destination folder.  
This is especially helpful for restoring missing or incorrect metadata after exports from cloud services, WhatsApp, Windows/Android screenshots, or photo moves.
